	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive conductance and delay analysis of graphene nano-ribbon ({GNR)} interconnects. The conductance model of {GNR} is derived using a simple tight binding model and the linear response Landauer formula. Several {GNR} structures are examined, and the conductance among them and other interconnect materials (copper, tungsten and carbon nanotubes) is compared. Impact of different model parameters (mean free path, Fermi level and edge specularity) on the conductance is discussed. An {RLC} equivalent circuit model is defined to analyze both global and local {GNR} interconnect delays. The results reveal that till the very end of {ITRS'07} roadmap, {GNRs} cannot match the performance of global level copper or {SWCNTs}, unless multiple layers along with proper intercalation doping is used and specular nano-ribbon edge is achieved. However, multi-layer zigzag edged {GNRs} (zz-{GNRs)} can be comparable to copper at the local level, and can have much better performance than that of tungsten, implying possible application as local interconnects.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the extreme values statistics use for metal interconnect and dielectric reliability in microelectronics. For electromigration reliability on Cu lines, experimental failure times are obtained by using an especially designed test structure (multilink) allowing determination of successive lower failure times on a large set of samples. It is shown that the experimental statistical distributions of minima failure times using our multilink structures are deductible from the usual single Cu lines lognormal distribution with the help of extreme values and order statistics. The analytical transformations from single interconnect lognormal distribution to the successive first, second, and third minima failure time distributions are derived with the help of scaling parameters. In particular, the first failure time's distribution is a Weibull distribution whose parameters are a simple expression of the total number of links and the parent lognormal distribution parameters. Since time-dependent dielectric breakdown follows also Weibull statistics, the origin of parent distribution and its analytical possible form are similarly discussed in the framework of extreme values statistics. The statistics of successive breakdown are also derived from order statistics.},

With the μ-Czochralski process based on a pulsed-laser crystallization, Si grains with a diameter of 6 μm are successfully formed on predetermined positions. Single-grain ({SG)} Si {TFTs} are fabricated inside the single-grain with mobility for electron and holes of 600 {cm2/V} s and 200 {cm2/V} s, respectively. Two layers of the {SG} Si {TFT} were vertically stacked and successfully implemented into {CMOS} inverter, {3D} {6T-SRAM} and single-grain lateral {PIN} photo-diode with in-pixel amplifier. Those results indicate that the {SG} {TFTs} are attractive for use in monolithic {3D-ICs} on an arbitrary substrate including a glass and even a plastic for applications such as ultra-high-density memories, logic-to-logic integration, {CPU} integrated display, and high-definition image sensor for artificial retina.},

In this paper, we develop a spectral approach to multi-way ratio-cut partitioning that provides a generalization of the ratio-cut cost metric to L-way partitioning and a lower bound on this cost metric. Our approach involves finding the k smallest eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of the Laplacian of the graph. The eigenvectors provide an embedding of the graph's n vertices into a k-dimensional subspace. We devise a time and space efficient clustering heuristic to coerce the points in the embedding into k partitions.

	abstract = {Three dimensional integrated circuits ({3D-ICs)} are emerging as a viable solution to the interconnect scaling problem. During early design space exploration, a large number of possible partitioning solutions are evaluated w.r.t. performance, area, through-silicon-via ({TSV)} count, etc. During this evaluation process, the number of test-{TSVs} need to be added to the total {TSV} count, to prevent unexpected area overhead later on in the design flow. While a fixed test-{TSV} count may provide sufficient guardbanding, in this paper we show that it often overestimates the actual number of test-{TSVs} required. Currently, the only way to determine the pareto-optimial test-{TSV} count is to sweep the test-{TSV} constraint, and repeatedly apply {3D} test architecture optimization algorithms. This process is time consuming, and is too slow to be used in automated partitioning. In this paper, we present a quick and accurate estimation of the pareto-optimal number of test-{TSVs} required for a given partition. This can be used as an input to the partitioner to quickly estimate the total number of {TSVs} used for a given partition, reducing over-design.},

	abstract = {The reported compact {SOI-MOSFET} model hiroshima university starc igfet model-silicon on thin buried oxide ({HiSIM-SOTB)} has been developed for devices with ultrathin silicon on insulator ({SOI)} and buried oxide ({BOX)} layers. The potential distribution determined by the Poisson equation is accurately solved with the Newton iteration method across the {SOI} layer and in the substrate on the backside of the {BOX} for source and drain side of the device. All charges including accumulation and inversion charges on both side of the {BOX} are explicitly considered in the Poisson equation. It is found that different from the double-gate {MOSFET}, the influence of the impurity concentration of the bulk substrate below the {BOX} must be also explicitly considered to capture all measured properties of the silicon on thin buried oxide ({SOTB)} {MOSFET.} A further modeling challenge of the thin {SOI} and {BOX} layers, which had to be overcome, is that charge neutrality is not independently preserved at the front-gate oxide or at {BOX} side, but only totally within the whole device. Additionally it is found that, due to the consistent potential- and charge-based model formulation, the developed {HiSIM-SOTB} model can reproduce not only {TCAD} and measured {SOTB} device data but is even capable to predict the effects of structural variations, including the limiting case of the double-gate {MOSFET} structure.},

The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0.51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional spring pins called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows \$-\$1-{dB} bandwidth of 3.73 {GHz} for 0.8-mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by {TDR}, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular spring pins.},

The task of thermal management must necessarily be shared both by the heat sink, which transfers internally generated heat to the ambient, and by using thermally conscious design methods. Second, the power to be delivered to a {3D} chip, per package pin, is tremendously increased, leading to significant complications in the task of reliable power delivery.

The requirements for the Lg and Lspace are derived from the {3D} device simulation and the effective cell size that competes with the planar {NAND.} The simulations reveal that Lg = Lspace = 20 nm (40 nm layer pitch) is achievable for bit-cost scalable ({BiCS)-type} {3D} {NAND} with the 90 nm diameter hole. If the number of stacked layers is 22 with the layer pitch of 40 nm, the effective cell size of the {3D} {NAND} corresponds to that of 15 nm planar {NAND} technology. Furthermore, cell characteristics of the macaroni body channel with various Φ are investigated. Although macaroni body channel improves cell characteristics at Φ = 90 nm, a cell with Φ = 60 nm without macaroni body structure shows better characteristics.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ({3D)} flash memory is emerging to fulfil the ever-increasing demands of storage capacity. In {3D} {NAND} flash memory, multiple layers are stacked to increase bit density and reduce bit cost of flash memory. However, the physical architecture of {3D} flash memory leads to a higher probability of disturbance to adjacent physical pages and greatly increases bit error rates. This paper presents {3D-FlashMap}, a novel physical-location-aware block mapping strategy for three-dimensional {NAND} flash memory. {3D-FlashMap} permutes the physical mapping of blocks and maximizes the distance between consecutively logical blocks, which can significantly reduce the disturbance to adjacent physical pages and effectively enhance the reliability. We apply {3D-FlashMap} to a representative flash storage system. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce uncorrectable page errors by 85\% with less than 2\% space overhead in comparison with the baseline scheme.},

Different physical and morphological aspects of contacts with organic or other emerging materials such as graphene, semiconducting dichalcogenides such as \$rm {MoS\_2\$}, or {NW} devices are described. The electrical behavior of the contacts is studied in {OTFTs}, and circuit models that describe them are reviewed. Two trends are observed in the current–voltage curves of the contacts of different {OTFTs:} linear and nonlinear, and different models are used to explain them. A unified model for the contact region that reproduces both trends and gathers the different physical and structural features of the contacts is developed. It is described by a single parameter and introduced in a generic analytical model for {TFTs.} The variability in {OTFT} structures, materials, and fabrication approaches gives rise to a strong variability in the values of the parameters of the model. In this regard, a characterization technique to determine the value of the parameters of the model from experimental data is also developed. Different physical tests are proposed to validate the results of the technique. The procedure is applied to recent experimental data for different pentacene-based transistors. The good agreement between the experimental data and our analytical results provides a way to relate the parameters of the model with the physical or geometrical origin of the contact effects in {OTFTs.}},

Evaluating the economic efficiency of test operations in the interposer-based {3D} {IC} thus is important. We propose a cost model for the Die-to-Wafer ({D2W)} and Die-to-Die ({D2D)} stacking, including manufacturing cost and test cost. A tool which is based on the proposed cost model is developed. We use this tool for cost analysis and for finding the most cost effective test flow. The results show that, in some applications, test flows including the iterative known-good stack ({KGS)} test and the pre-bond interposer test significantly reduce the cost, when the {KGS} test yield is lower than 98.2\% and the pre-bond interposer test yield is lower than 99.38\%. A Shmoo plot is depicted to show the lower bound of the yield of the final package level test, given the number of stacked dies and the final yield. For different applications, the proposed model evaluates the critical yield or cost values, which helps the designers to determine the most cost effective test flow and the system architecture.},

	abstract = {In this study, a three-dimensional ({3D)} integrated circuit ({IC)} chip stacking structure with a through-silicon via ({TSV)} is proposed. A high aspect ratio, void-free Cu electro-plating technology was achieved through super filling. The aspect ratio of the {TSV} was larger than eight. For chip stacking, {Cu/Sn} micro bumps with diameters less than 20 μm were used. Solder shape prediction using surface evolver showed good correlation with experiment results within a 2.5\% error. Thin wafer handling technology with thermal plastic material was also adopted in this paper. The outgassing issue for silicon dioxide ({SiO2)} was improved dramatically when an additional silicon nitride ({Si3N4)} film deposition was made. Using the slide-off method with thermal plastic thin wafer handling material, an eight-inch wafer with a thickness of less than 50 μm was processed. After the die-saw process, ten chips could be stacked using the die bonder. Thermal cycling reliability test was also conducted with the temperature ranging from -55 to {125°C.} The reliability life for the proposed structure was 3,777 cycles from the Weibull plot. The average resistance for one interconnection was less than 50 mΩ. A {3D} finite element model was also established in this study. The {CTE} mismatch between the polyimide and the silicon resulted in warpage. The simulation results showed that the maximum von Mises stress occurred at the corner of the {TSV} which could lead to a failure mode called “copper pumping.” For the von Mises stress in the micro bump, the maximum value occurred between the inter-metallic compound and the substrate copper pad. From the cross-sectional {SEM} image of the failed sample after thermal cycling test, the failure mode had good correlation with the simulation results. Equivalent plastic strain was around 0.11\% in this simulation. As both silicon substrate and silicon chips were used in this study, a small eq- - uivalent plastic strain is expected.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) technology promises higher integration density and lower interconnection complexity and delay. At present, however, not much work on circuit applications has been done due to lack of insight into 3-D circuit architecture and performance. One of the purposes of realizing 3-D integration is to reduce the interconnect complexity and delay of two dimensions (2-D), which are widely considered as the barriers to continued performance gains in future technology generations. Thus, understanding the interconnect and its related issues, such as the impact on circuit performance, is key to 3-D circuit applications. In this paper, we present a stochastic 3-D interconnect model and study the impact of 3-D integration on circuit performance and power consumption. To model 3-D interconnect, we divide 3-D wires into two parts (horizontal wires and vertical wires) and derive their stochastic distributions. Based on those distributions, we estimate the delay distribution. We show that 3-D structures effectively reduce the number of long delay nets, significantly reduce the number of repeaters, and dramatically improve circuit performance. With 3-D integration, circuits can be clocked at frequencies much higher (double or even triple) than 2-D},

Current models have been developed based on the exact device geometry, 2-D doping profile and operating temperature. A circuit level model of junction {BTBT} leakage (which is unprecedented) has been developed. Simple models of the subthreshold current and the gate current have been presented. Here, for the first time, the impact of quantum mechanical behavior of substrate electrons, on the circuit leakage has been analyzed. Using the compact current model, a transistor has been modeled as a Sum of Current Sources ({SCS).} The {SCS} transistor model has been used to estimate the total leakage in simple logic gates and complex logic circuits (designed with transistors of 25nm effective length) at the room and at the elevated temperatures.},

Such tools, targeting multiple design facets and cost trade-off analysis, would allow designers to arrive at major decisions regarding architecture and implementations fabrics. We focus in this paper on the efficient estimation of on-chip power delivery requirements consistent with supply noise limits. We propose a number of algorithms to find the minimum number of through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} that deliver power with acceptable {IR} drops. Minimizing the number of {TSVs} reduces the total silicon die area which is the main recurring cost during fabrication. To compute the {TSV} requirements realistically, we utilize power traces derived from benchmark-based functional behavior of processors. To speed-up our simulations, we develop a trace selection technique that utilizes the relevant portion of power traces representing the worst load for {IR} drops. The trace selection scheme reduces the number of simulations by 51×. Using these traces we find the best spatial allocation of {TSVs} for a 3-D implementation of a processor. The iterative algorithm can be run in approximately one hour on a 40-processor cluster.},

With the cost-driven design optimization flow, we can achieve cost saving up to 19\% for {TSV-based} {3D} designs, and 26\% for interposer-based {3D} designs, respectively, compared to the baseline designs.},

We discuss the traditional min-cut and ratio cut bipartitioning formulations along with multi-way extensions and newer problem formulations, e.g., constraint-driven partitioning (for {FPGAs)} and partitioning with module replication. Our discussion of solution approaches is divided into four major categories: move-based approaches, geometric representations, combinatorial formulations, and clustering approaches. Move-based algorithms iteratively explore the space of feasible solutions according to a neighborhood operator; such methods include greed, iterative exchange, simulated annealing, and evolutionary algorithms. Algorithms based on geometric representations embed the circuit netlist in some type of “geometry”, e.g., a 1-dimensional linear ordering or a multi-dimensional vector space; the embeddings are commonly constructed using spectral methods. Combinatorial methods transform the partitioning problem into another type of optimization, e.g., based on network flows or mathematical programming. Finally, clustering algorithms merge the netlist modules into many small clusters; we discuss methods which combine clustering with existing algorithms (e.g., two-phase partitioning). The paper concludes with a discussion of benchmarking in the {VLSI} {CAD} partitioning literature and some perspectives on more promising directions for future work.},

However, {TSVs} occupy significant silicon area due to their sheer size, which has a great effect on the power and performance of {3D} {ICs.} Whereas well-managed {TSVs} alleviate routing congestion, reduce wirelength, and improve performance, excessive or ill-managed {TSVs} not only increase the die area but also degrade performance and power. In this chapter, we study the impact of {TSVs} on the quality of {3D} {IC} layouts. We first study two design schemes, namely {TSV} co-placement (irregular {TSV} placement) and {TSV} site (regular {TSV} placement), for the design of {3D} {ICs.} In addition, we develop a force-directed {3D} gate-level placement algorithm to find optimal locations of {TSVs} and gates. One key problem to solve in regular {TSV} placement is how to assign {3D} nets to pre-placed {TSVs.} To solve this problem effectively, we study two {TSV} assignment algorithms, compare them with other {TSV} assignment algorithms, and analyze the impact of the quality of {TSV} assignment algorithms on {3D} {ICs.} Experimental results show that the wirelength of {3D} {ICs} is shorter than that of {2D} {ICs} by up to 25 \%.

In this paper, a new {TSV-based} interconnect technology, named under-pad interconnect ({UPI)}, has been developed for {3D-stacking} of {NAND} flash memory chips using existing {CMOS-compatible} processes. The basic idea is to use the existing wire-bonding ({WB)} based {NAND} flash memory wafer to fabricate blind-via interconnect under bond pad from the backside of a wafer, followed by stacking the chips with {UPIs} onto the substrate to build a {3D-module.} The details of the fabrication process development and the {NAND} flash memory {3D-stacking} methodology will be reviewed and discussed.},

We derive a new {3D} wirelength distribution model considering {TSV} size.

	abstract = {Pre-bond test is preferred for a three-dimensional integrated circuit ({3D} {IC)}, since it reduces stacking yield loss and thus saves cost. In this paper, we present two schemes for testing through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} by performing on-chip screening before wafer thinning and bonding. The first scheme is for blind {TSVs}, which have one end floating, using a charge-sharing technique commonly seen in {DRAM.} The second scheme is for open-sleeve {TSVs}, which have one end shorted to the substrate, using a voltage-dividing technique commonly seen in {ROM.} By virtue of the inherent capacitive and resistive characteristics, we detect the {TSVs} out of a specified range as anomalies, taking into account the effects of process variations in the detection circuitry. The statistical design by Monte Carlo simulation using {TSMC} 65nm low-power process shows that for blind {TSVs}, the best overkill ratio is below 6\%. For open-sleeve {TSVs}, inherent limitations restrict the applicability, so more work needs to be done in the future. Our implementation enjoys little area overhead, requiring only a simple sense amplifier and a write buffer that are shared among a number of {TSVs.} Reducing the number of {TSVs} that share a test module will reduce the test time, but increase the area overhead. For blind {TSVs}, the parallelism also affects the overkill and escape rates.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the total resistivity of a thin metal film is calculated from a model in which three types of electron scattering mechanisms are simultaneously operative: an isotropic background scattering (due to the combined effects of phonons and point defects), scattering due to a distribution of planar potentials (grain boundaries), and scattering due to the external surfaces. The intrinsic or bulk resistivity is obtained by solving a Boltzmann equation in which both grain-boundary and background scattering are accounted for. The total resistivity is obtained by imposing boundary conditions due to the external surfaces (as in the Fuchs theory) on this Boltzmann equation. Interpretation of published data on grain-boundary scattering in bulk materials in terms of the calculated intrinsic resistivity, and of thin-film data in terms of the calculated total resistivity suggests that (i) the grain-boundary reflection coefficient in Al is ≈ 0.15, while it is somewhat higher in Cu; (ii) the observed thickness dependence of the resistivity in thin films is due to grain-boundary scattering as well as to the Fuchs size effect; and (iii) the common observation that single-crystal films possess lower resistivities than polycrystalline films may be accounted for by grain-boundary effects rather than by differences in the nature of surface scattering.},

A large body of work shows that a good layout hierarchy, or partitioning tree, as measured by the associated Rent parameter, will correspond to an area-efficient layout. We define the intrinsic Rent parameter of a netlist to be the minimum possible Rent parameter of any partitioning tree for the netlist. Experimental results show that spectra-based ratio cut partitioning algorithms yield partitioning trees with the lowest observed Rent parameter over all benchmarks and over all algorithms tested. For examples where the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, spectral ratio cut partitioning yields a partitioning tree with Rent parameter essentially identical to this theoretical optimum. These results have deep implications with respect to both the choice of partitioning algorithms for top-down layout, as well as new approaches to layout area estimation.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of the {TSV} resistance ({RTSV)} on the performance of boost converters for Solid State Drive ({SSD)} using circuit simulation. When {RTSV} is 0 Omega, both the rising time (trise) from 0 V to 15 V and the energy during boosting (Eloss) of the output voltage ({VOUT)} are 10.6\% and 6.6\% of the conventional charge pump respectively. In contrast, when {RTSV} is 200 Omega, for example, trise is 30.1\% and Eloss is 22.8\% of the conventional charge pump. Besides, {VOUT} cannot be boosted above 20 V when {RTSV} is larger than 210 Omega. Therefore, in order to maintain the advantages of the boost converter over the charge pump in terms of trise and Eloss, the reduction of {RTSV} is very important.},

This reduction is particularly attractive in processors where it is desirable to reduce, the access time between the main logic die and the L2 cache or the main memory die. Process variations in {2D} {ICs} lead to a drop in parametric yield (as measured by speed, leakage and sales profits), which forces manufacturers to speed bin their chips and to sell slow chips at reduced prices. In this paper we develop a model to quantify the impact of process variations on the parametric yield of {3D} {ICs}, and then we propose a number of integration strategies that use a graph-theoretic framework to maximize the performance, parametric yield and profits of {3D} {ICs.} Comparing our proposed strategies to current yield-oblivious methods, it is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the number of {3D} {ICs} in the fastest speed bins by almost 2times, while simultaneously reducing the number of slow {ICs} by 29.4\%. This leads to an improvement in performance by up to 6.45\% and an increase of about 12.48\%-in total sales revenue using up-to-date market price models.},

The accumulation capacitance of the air-gap {TSVs} is 48 {fF}, and the leakage current is as low as 1.22 {pA} at bias voltage of 20 V.

In sub-100-nm technologies, however, microscopic excess noise starts to play a significant role and its incorporation in thermal noise models is unavoidable. Here, we will review several crucial ingredients for accurate {RF} noise modeling, with emphasis on sub-100-nm technologies. In particular, a detailed derivation and discussion are presented of our microscopic excess noise model.

However, all such advantages will ultimately have to be translatee into cost savings when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, system-level cost analysis at the early design stage is imperative to help the decision making on whether {3D} integration should be adopted. In this chapter, we discuss the design estimation method for {3D} {ICs} at the early design stage. We also describe a cost analysis model to study the cost implication for {3D} {ICs} and address cost-related problems for {3D} {IC} design.},

In this paper, four analog test circuits are explored for the purposes of detecting these pinholes.

This allows the island-gate {SSL} devices [1] and metal interconnections be laid out in double pitch, creating much larger process window for {BL} pitch scaling; (2) A novel staircase {BL} contact formation method using binary sum of only M lithography and etching steps to achieve {2M} contacts.

	title = {Compact transient thermal model for {3D} {ICs} with liquid cooling via enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries},
	abstract = {The advent of {3D} stacked {ICs} with accumulating heat fluxes stresses thermal reliability and is responsible for temperature driven performance deterioration of the electronic systems Hot spots with power densities typically rising up to 250 W/cm2 are not acceptable, with the result of limited performance improvement in next generation high-performance microprocessor stacks. Unfortunately traditional back-side cooling only scales with the chip stack footprint, but not with the number of tiers. Direct heat removal from the {IC} dies via inter-tier liquid cooling is a promising solution to address this problem. In this regard, a thermal-aware design of a {3D} {IC} with liquid cooling for optimal electronic performance and reliability requires fast modeling and simulation of the liquid cooling during the early stages of the design. In this paper, we propose a novel compact transient thermal modeling ({CTTM)} scheme for liquid cooling in {3D} {ICs} via microchannels and enhanced heat transfer cavity geometries such as pin-fin structures. The model is compatible with the existing thermal-{CAD} tools for {ICs} and offers significant speed-up over commercial computational fluid dynamics simulators (13478x for pin-fin geometry with 1.1\% error in temperature). In addition, the model is highly flexible and it provides a generic framework in which heat transfer coefficient data from numerical simulations or existing correlations can be incorporated depending upon the speed/accuracy needs of the designer. We have also studied the effects of using different techniques for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients on the accuracy of the model. This study highlights the need to consider developing flow conditions to accurately model the temperature field in the chip stack. The use of correlation data from fully developed flows only results in temperature error as high as 9 K (about 41\%) near the inlet.},

For semi-global interconnects, either latency or power dissipation can be substantially improved if bundles of {SWNTs} are used. The improvements increase as cross-sectional dimensions scale down.

	abstract = {3-D integration technology is emerging as an attractive alternative to increase the transistor count for future chips. The majority of the existing 3-D integrated circuit ({IC)} research is focused on the performance, power, density, and heterogeneous integration benefits offered by 3-D integration. All such advantages, however, ultimately have to translate into cost evaluation when a design strategy has to be decided. Consequently, system-level cost analysis at early design stages is imperative to decide on whether 3-D integration should be adopted. This paper presents a cost estimation method for 3-D {ICs} at early design stages and proposes a set of cost models that include wafer cost, 3-D bonding cost, package cost, and cooling cost. The proposed 3-D {IC} cost estimation method can help designers analyze the cost implication for 3-D {ICs} during the design space exploration at the early stage, and it enables a cost-driven 3-D {IC} design flow that can guide the design choice toward a cost-effective direction. Based on the proposed cost estimation method, this paper demonstrates two case studies that explore the cost benefits of 3-D integration for application-specific integrated circuit designs and many-core microprocessor designs style, respectively. Finally, this paper suggests the optimum partitioning strategy for future 3-D {IC} designs.},

	abstract = {One of the most effective ways to deal with the area and capacitance overhead issues with through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} in {3D} {ICs} is to reduce the size of {TSVs} themselves. Today, the diameter of the smallest {TSV} available is around 1 μm, and this is expected to reach sub-micron dimensions in a few years. This downscaling of {TSVs} requires research on the impact of nano-scale {TSVs} on the quality of {3D} {IC} designs to provide academia and industry with the quantified effects. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the impact of nano-scale {TSVs} on the area, wirelength, delay, and power quality of today and future {3D} {IC} designs. For our future process technology, we develop a 22nm standard cell and interconnect library. We also use four sets of {TSV-related} dimensions in our {GDSII-level} {3D} {IC} layouts. Based on these resources, we present a thorough study on the impact of nano-scale {TSVs} on the design quality of today and future {3D} {ICs.}},

	abstract = {Theoretical works suggest the possibility and usefulness of strain engineering of graphene by predicting remarkable properties, such as Dirac cone merging, bandgap opening and pseudo magnetic field generation. However, most of these predictions have not yet been confirmed because it is experimentally difficult to control the magnitude and type (e.g., uniaxial, biaxial, and so forth) of strain in graphene devices. Here we report two novel methods to apply strain without bending the substrate. We employ thin films of evaporated metal and organic insulator deposited on graphene, which shrink after electron beam irradiation or heat application. These methods make it possible to apply both biaxial strain and in-plane isotropic compressive strain in a well-controlled manner. Raman spectroscopy measurements show a clear splitting of the degenerate states of the G-band in the case of biaxial strain, and G-band blue shift without splitting in the case of in-plane isotropic compressive strain. In the case of biaxial strain application, we find out the ratio of the strain component perpendicular to the stretching direction is at least three times larger than what was previously observed, indicating that shrinkage of the metal or organic insulator deposited on graphene induces both tensile and compressive strain in this atomically thin material. Our studies present for the first time a viable way to apply strain to graphene without the need to bend the substrate.},

	abstract = {Sub-30 nm {TFT} {CT} {NAND} flash devices have been extensively studied. Although {TFT} devices were often believed to have much worse performance than bulk devices, our results show that as devices scale down to sub-30 nm, the {DC} characteristics (such as read current and subthreshold slope ({S.S.))} approach those of the bulk devices because sub-30 nm {TFT} devices often contain no grain boundaries. The memory window is also larger than the bulk planar devices due to the tri-gate structure that enhances the electric field during programming/erasing. However, a fair percentage of devices contain grain boundaries with poorer {S.S.} and gm. Interestingly, this only affects the {DC} characteristics but does not impact the memory window. Furthermore, grain boundaries do not increase the random telegraph noise. The most serious drawback of grain boundaries is the impact on self-boosting window caused by junction leakage.

	abstract = {A key problem in the effective use of large-scale integration is the design and partitioning of computer logic to achieve sufficiently high circuit-to-pin ratios. In this paper a power-law relationship between pins and partitioned circuits is discussed and empirical evidence is presented that implies that the pin requirement is a sensitive function of the performance level of the logic. Two techniques for increasing the circuit-to-pin ratio are discussed. The first is to serialize the interchip transfer of information that results in a degradation in performance of the logic. The second is to encode the information to be transferred so that fewer pins are required but without reducing the performance. The results of experiments using the encoding principle to map a small logic graph onto chips are presented to obtain an indication of the effectiveness of this technique. It is shown that the relationship between circuits and pins when using encoding remains a power law.},

	abstract = {For the demands of multifunction, high density interconnection, high performance and integration of homogeneous or heterogeneous {ICs}, three dimensional {IC} ({3DIC)} packaging technologies by through silicon via ({TSV)} and microbump were widely studied recently. Intending to learn the reliability performance of Pb-free microjoints, 4 chips were interconnected with one Si interposer by {Sn2.5Ag} microbumps, sealed by a capillary underfill and then did the reliability assessment under different environments. The 4 chips have the same size of 4.6 mm by 4.6 mm by 100 um, and were assembled on one Si interposer with a dimension of 20 mm by 20 mm by 300 mm by a chip on wafer ({CoW)} bonder. There were more then 3000 microbumps on each chip and totally over 12,000 microbumps were on the Si interposer. The bump pitch and passivation opening of the test vehicle were 20 um and 6 um, respectively, an under bump metallization ({UBM)} layer of 5.0 um Cu / 3.0 um Ni was plating on Al trace and then {Sn2.5Ag} Pb-free solder bump with a thickness around 5.0 um was then deposited on the {UBM} layer. During bonding, the microjoints were formed at a peak temperature of {280°C}, and the microgaps were then filled by a capillary underfill and cured at {150°C} for 30 min. Subsequently, the assemblies were respectively inspected by an X-ray and a scanning acoustic microscope ({SAM)} to determine the quality of microjoints including bonding accuracy, formation of interconnections and the percentage of gas voids within the underfill. Afterwards, the test vehicles were baked at {125°C} for 24 h and then stored under the test condition of {30°C} / 60\% {RH} for 192 h and finally reflowed at {260°C} for 3 times to screen the samples for reliability tests, the {SAM} was again used to check whether the delamination defect was formed within the microgap. The reliability tests including temperature cycling test ({TCT)}, thermal shock test ({TST)}, high temperature storage test ({HTS)}, pressure - - cooker test ({PCT)} and thermal humidity storage test ({THST)} were done according to the {JEDEC} standards. The results showed that the thermomechanical stress induced by {TCT} and {TST} damaged the assemblies, and the failure mode was also discussed in this investigation.},

	volume = {2},
	issn = {2156-3357},
	abstract = {Through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} have two negative effects in the design of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3-D {ICs).} First, {TSV} insertion leads to silicon area overhead. In addition, nonnegligible {TSV} capacitance causes delay overhead in 3-D signal paths. Therefore, obtaining all benefits such as wirelength reduction and performance improvement from 3-D {ICs} is highly dependent on {TSV} size and capacitance. Meanwhile, {TSVs} are downscaled to minimize their negative effects, and sub-micron {TSVs} are expected to be fabricated in the near future. At the same time, the devices are also downscaled beyond 32 nm and 22 nm, so future 3-D {ICs} will very likely be built with sub-micron {TSVs} and advanced device technologies. In this paper, we investigate the impact of sub-micron {TSVs} on the quality of today and future 3-D {ICs.} For future process technologies, we develop 22 nm and 16 nm libraries. Using these future process libraries and an existing 45 nm library, we generate 3-D {IC} layouts with different {TSV} sizes and capacitances and study the impact of sub-micron {TSVs} thoroughly.},

	abstract = {This paper is a study of the electromigration ({EM)} effects of micro bumps at silicon-silicon interface in {3DIC} package for 28nm technology and beyond. Two joint schemes were designed and fabricated: one of the schemes was the joining of Sn-capped Cu post to {ENEPIG} (Electroless-Nickel-Electroless-Palladium-Immersion-Gold) {UBM} (Under-Bump-Metallurgy) pad on silicon substrate; the other scheme was the joining of top Cu post to bottom Cu post that formed a symmetrical joint structure. In-situ resistance was monitored to study the situation of joint degradation. During the test, a progressive resistance change was observed, which differed from the test data of conventional C4 (Controlled Collapse Chip Connections) bumps under regular test condition. (The detail will be described in this paper.) The experimental results showed that the rapid resistance shifts of both micro bump schemes were due to the high current density and the fast Cu-Sn {IMC} (Inter Metallic Compound) formation.},

The Si substrate of top bonded wafer is uniformly thinned to {\textasciitilde}35 μm by backside grinding and polishing, followed by wet-etching using {TMAH.} No visible changes at the bonding interface and damage-free interconnect structures are observed after the thinning process. Both mechanical and electrical integrity of the bonded pairs are maintained after the three-step baseline thinning process, with electrical tests on wafers with multi-level copper interconnect test structures showing only a slight change after bonding and thinning. This thinning process works well for Si removal to an etch-stop layer, although present process uniformity is not adequate to thin bulk Si substrates. Other issues such as wafer breakage and edge chipping during Si thinning and their possible solutions are also addressed.},

	abstract = {Presentation skills, such as oral expression and public speaking, have normally been relegated to the background in engineering degree programs. In recent years, however, the labor market has specifically demanded these kinds of skills in engineers. Accordingly, new engineering degrees, adapted to the goals of the Bologna Declaration or {ABET} criteria, consider presentation skills as being fundamental transferable skills. In practice, however, many engineering degree programs do not specifically foster these skills even though they are included in the syllabus. This paper proposes a presentation-skills training that uses the Master's thesis as an opportunity for fostering presentation-related skills. This activity has students deliver a scheduled series of rehearsals, in front of their classmates and tutors, for their officially assessed presentation of their Master's thesis work. The paper also presents a Web tool specifically designed for uploading recordings of the rehearsal presentations for feedback online as a complementary method for fostering presentation-related skills. Finally, the results of carrying out the proposed resource over a 4-year period from 2009 to 2013 are discussed; they show that students following the proposed methodology had higher than average marks, all receiving an A+, and 82\% of them receiving an A+ with distinction.},

The phasor method is a mathematical method for solving linear sinusoidal steady-state circuits and time-varying electromagnetic fields. This paper traces the history and diffusion of the phasor method in the discipline of electrical engineering in China. In 1914, Sidney Roby Sheldon, an American teacher at the Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry, Shanghai, China, introduced the phasor method to his students in his Alternating Currents course. The textbook used was Elements of Electrical Engineering (Volume {II)} by William Suddards Franklin and William Esty. In 1920, The Electrical Magazine published a paper {“Complex} number and its application” by Sijiu Shi (editor of the electrical engineering section of this periodical). This is the earliest example found of Chinese literature introducing the phasor method. In the 1930s, Principles of Alternating Currents, an American electrical engineering textbook that includes the phasor method, was translated by Chinese scholars; this Chinese version promoted the use of the phasor method in China's electrical engineering field. Alternating Current Circuits, authored by the Chinese university professor Pen Tung Sah and published in 1948, may be the earliest example of the phasor method being included in a Chinese electrical engineering textbook; it played an important role in popularizing the phasor method in China.},

This paper proposes a {3D} {IC} cost evaluation framework based on fast tier number estimation. Using a reformulated Rent's rule, this study efficiently determines the number k of tiers to minimize the through-silicon via count and then automatically partitions a gate-level netlist into k tiers to minimize the total cost. This study conducted experiments on eight industrial test cases to show cost efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, results prove that the reformulated Rent's rule indicates a strong correlation between the tier number and through-silicon via usage.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ({3D)} {ICs} promise to overcome barriers in interconnect scaling by leveraging fast, dense inter-die vias, thereby offering benefits of improved performance, higher memory bandwidth, smaller form factors, and heterogeneous integration. However, when deciding to adopt this emerging technology as a mainstream design approach, designers must consider the cost of {3D} integration. {IC} testing is a key factor that affects the final product cost, and it could be a major portion of the total {IC} cost. In {3D} {IC} design, various testing strategies and different integration methods could affect the final product cost dramatically, and the interaction with other cost factors could result in various trade-offs. This paper develops a comprehensive and parameterized testing cost model for {3D} {IC} integration, and analyzes the trade-offs associated with testing strategies and testing circuit overheads. With the proposed testing cost model, designers can explore the most cost-effective integration and testing strategies for {3D} {IC} chips.},

	abstract = {With power and cooling increasingly contributing to the operating costs of a datacenter, energy efficiency is the key driver in server design. One way to improve energy efficiency is to implement innovative interconnect technologies such as {3D} stacking. Three-dimensional stacking technology introduces new opportunities for future servers to become low power, compact, and possibly mobile. This chapter introduces an architecture called Picoserver that employs {3D} technology to bond one die containing several simple slow processing cores with multiple memory dies sufficient for a primary memory. The multiple memory dies are composed of {DRAM.} This use of {3D} stacks readily facilitates wide low-latency buses between processors and memory. These remove the need for an L2 cache allowing its area to be re-allocated to additional simple cores. The additional cores allow the clock frequency to be lowered without impairing throughput. Lower clock frequency means that thermal constraints, a concern with {3D} stacking, are easily satisfied. {PicoServer} is intentionally simple, requiring only the simplest form of {3D} technology where die are stacked on top of one another. Our intent is to minimize risk of introducing a new technology ({3D)} to implement a class of low-cost, low-power, compact server architectures.},

A frequency-dependent impedance extraction method is developed for both single-walled {CNT} ({SWCNT)} and multiwalled {CNT} ({MWCNT)} bundle interconnects. The method is subsequently verified by comparing the results with those derived directly from the Maxwell's equations. Our analysis reveals for the first time that skin effect in {CNT} (particularly {MWCNT)} bundles is significantly reduced compared to that in conventional metal conductors, which makes them very attractive and promising material for high-frequency applications, including high-quality (Q) factor on-chip inductor design in high-performance {RF/mixed-signal} circuits. It is shown that such unique high-frequency properties of {CNTs} essentially arise due to their large momentum relaxation time (leading to their large kinetic inductance), which causes the skin depths to saturate with frequency and thereby limits resistance increase at high frequencies in a bundle structure. It is subsequently shown that {CNT-based} planar spiral inductors can achieve more than three times higher Q factor than their Cu-based counterparts without using any magnetic materials or Q factor enhancement techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new spectral partitioning formulation which directly incorporates vertex size information by modifying the Laplacian of the graph. Modifying the Laplacian produces a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is reduced to the standard eigenvalue problem. Experiments show that the scaled ratio-cut costs of results on benchmarks with arbitrary vertex size improve by 22\% when the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in the spectral partitioner {KP} are replaced by the eigenvectors of our modified Laplacian. The inability to handle vertex sizes in the spectral partitioning formulation has been a limitation in applying spectral partitioning in a multilevel setting. We investigate whether our new formulation effectively removes this limitation by combining it with a simple multilevel bottom-up clustering algorithm and an iterative improvement algorithm for partition refinement. Experiments show that in a multilevel setting where the spectral partitioner {KP} provides the initial partitions of the most contracted graph, using the modified Laplacian in place of the standard Laplacian is more efficient and more effective in the partitioning of graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices; average improvements of 17\% and 18\% are observed for graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices, respectively. Comparisons with other ratio-cut based partitioners on hypergraphs with unit-size as well as arbitrary-size vertices, show that the multilevel spectral partitioner produces either better results or almost identical results more efficiently},

	abstract = {Physics-based equivalent circuit models are presented for armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons ({GNRs)}, and their conductances have been benchmarked against those of carbon nanotubes and copper wires. Atomically thick {GNRs} with smooth edges can potentially have smaller resistances compared with copper wires with unity aspect ratios for widths below 8 nm and stacks of noninteracting {GNRs} can have substantially smaller resistivities compared to Cu wires. It is shown that rough edges can increase the resistance of narrow {GNRs} by an order of magnitude. This fact highlights the need for patterning methods that can produce relatively smooth edges to fabricate low resistance {GNR} interconnects.},

In the second part, the {ITER} reference design of the {HF} sensor has been assessed and showed some potential weaknesses, which led us to the conclusion that alternative designs could usefully be examined. Several options have been explored, and are presented in the third part: (a) direct laser cutting a metallic tube, (b) stacking of plane windings manufactured from a tungsten plate by electrical discharge machining, (c) coil using the conventional spring manufacture. In the fourth part, sensors using the low temperature co-fired ceramic technology ({LTCC)} are presented: (d) monolithic {1D} magnetic flux sensors based on {LTCC} technology, and (e) monolithic {3D} magnetic flux sensors based on the same {LTCC} technology. The solution which showed the best results is the monolithic {3D} magnetic flux sensor based on {LTCC.}},

A certain memory density may be achieved by any array architecture but with different numbers of stacking layers. A smaller pitch allows the achieving of high density at reasonable number of stacked memory layers (≤ 32) and thus potentially offers lower cost. {VG} {NAND} has good pitch scalability thus is very attractive. On the other hand, it is more difficult to decode the bit line in a {VG} architecture, thus decoding innovations are required for a compact array architecture design.

	abstract = {3-D monolithic integration ({3DMI)}, also termed as sequential integration, is a potential technology for future gigascale circuits. Since the device layers are processed in sequential order, the size of the vertical contacts is similar to traditional contacts unlike in the case of parallel 3-D integration with through silicon vias ({TSVs).} Given the advantage of such small contacts, {3DMI} enables manufacturing multiple active layers very close to each other. In this work we propose two different strategies of stacking standard cells in 3-D without breaking the regularity of the conventional design flow: a) Vertical stacking of diffusion areas (Intra-Cell stacking) that supports complete reuse of 2-D physical design tools and b) vertical stacking of cells over others (Cell-on-Cell stacking). A placement tool ({CELONCEL-placer)} targeting the Cell-on-Cell placement problem is proposed to allow high quality 3-D layout generation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of {CELONCEL} technique, fetching us an area gain of 37.5\%, 15.51\% reduction in wirelength, and 13.49\% improvement in overall delay, compared with a 2-D case when benchmarked across an interconnect dominated low-density-parity-check ({LDPC)} decoder at 45nm technology node.},

	abstract = {In this paper, through-silicon via ({TSV)} array in the form of one signal and four grounds ({1S4G)} are proposed to achieve high-frequency vertical connectivity for various three dimensional ({3D)} {IC} applications. Self-test method is developed to detect the conductor open and insulator short defects of {TSV} by capacitive and resistive measuring. Further a recovery mechanism for such a {TSV} array is introduced to enhance the {TSV} reliability. Test results will be configured to the {TSV} chain circuits by the central control logic and be used to determine the connection jumping between signal and redundant {TSVs.} This way, the failure {TSVs} could be replaced by the redundant ones. Simulation results demonstrate that the self-test circuit and central control logic could detect and recover the broken {TSVs} correctly. Moreover, the efficiency and area cost of the recovery mechanism is discussed, and it turns out that in a typical case of 96 signal {TSVs}, the chip yield could reach 90\% with {TSV} failure rate equal to 5\%, in exchange for less than 4\% area cost of self-test circuit in the whole {TSV} area.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ({3D)} {ICs} promise to overcome barriers in interconnect scaling by leveraging fast, dense inter-die vias, thereby offering benefits of improved performance, higher memory bandwidth, smaller form factors, and heterogeneous integration. However, when deciding to adopt this emerging technology as a mainstream design approach, designers must consider the cost of {3D} integration. {IC} testing is a key factor that affects the final product cost, and it could be a major portion of the total {IC} cost. In {3D} {IC} design, various testing strategies and different integration methods could affect the final product cost dramatically, and the interaction with other cost factors could result in various trade-offs. This paper develops a comprehensive and parameterized testing cost model for {3D} {IC} integration, and analyzes the trade-offs associated with testing strategies and testing circuit overheads. With the proposed testing cost model, designers can explore the most cost-effective integration and testing strategies for {3D} {IC} chips.},

This paper uses {3D-COSTAR}, a tool that considers costs involved in the whole {2.5D/3D-SIC} chain, including design, manufacturing, test, packaging and logistics, e.g. related to shipping wafers between a foundry and a test house; and provides the estimated overall cost for {2.5D/3D-SICs} and its cost breakdown for a given input parameter set, e.g., test flows, die yield and stack yield. As a case study, the tool is used to evaluate the overall {2.5D-SIC} cost for three test optimization problems: (a) the impact of the fault coverage of the pre-bond silicon interposer test, (b) the impact of pre-bond testing of active dies using either dedicated probe-pads or micro-bumps, and (c) the impact of mid-bond testing and logistics on the overall cost. The results show that for the selected parameters: (a) pre-bond testing of the interposer die is important for overall {2.5D-SIC} cost reduction; the higher the fault coverage, the lower the overall cost, (b) using micro-bump probing results in much lower overall cost as compared to probe-pads, and (c) mid-bond testing can be avoided for high stacking yield.},

The multiconductor transmission line ({MTL)} models and the simplified equivalent distributed {RC} models presented here consider the realistic effect of having contacts that couple only to the top layer. The {MTL} models are used to show the distribution of current among different layers along the interconnect length. For digital circuits and interconnect dimensions of interest, it is shown that the equivalent {RC} models have an error of less than 15\% in estimating the interconnect delay. However, for {RF} circuits where the accurate frequency response is important, it is shown that {MTL} models are essential. The optimal number of {GNR} layers to minimize the delay and energy-delay-product ({EDP)} are derived using the distributed {RC} models for futuristic technology nodes. Using the predictions made by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ({ITRS)}, it is shown that for short interconnects, multi-layer {GNR} with smooth edges can outperform copper.},

	abstract = {The graph partitioning problem is to divide the vertices of a graph into disjoint clusters to minimize the total cost of the edges cut by the clusters. A spectral partitioning heuristic uses the graph's eigenvectors to construct a geometric representation of the graph (e.g., linear orderings) which are subsequently partitioned. Our main result shows that when all the eigenvectors are used, graph partitioning reduces to a new vector partitioning problem. This result implies that as many eigenvectors as are practically possible should be used to construct a solution. This philosophy is in contrast to that of the widely used spectral bipartitioning ({SB)} heuristic (which uses only a single eigenvector) and several previous multi-way partitioning heuristics [8, 11, 17, 27, 38] (which use k eigenvectors to construct k-way partitionings). Our result motivates a simple ordering heuristic that is a multiple-eigenvector extension of {SB.} This heuristic not only significantly outperforms recursive {SB}, but can also yield excellent multi-way {VLSI} circuit partitionings as compared to [1, 11]. Our experiments suggest that the vector partitioning perspective opens the door to new and effective partitioning heuristics. The present paper updates and improves a preliminary version of this work [5].},

We also present a commercial router based monolithic inter-tier via ({MIV)} insertion methodology that dramatically improves the routability of monolithic {3D-ICs.} We develop a routing demand model for monolithic {3D-ICs}, and use it to develop an O(N) min-overflow partitioner that enhances routability by off-loading demand from one tier to another. This technique reduces the routed wirelength and the power delay product ({PDP)} by up to 4\% and 4.33\% respectively, under the same half-perimeter wirelength. This allows a two-tier monolithic {3D-IC} to achieve, on average, 19.2\% and 12.1\% improvement in routed wirelength and {PDP} over {2D}, even with reduced metal layer usage.},

	abstract = {Graphene nanoribbons ({GNRs)} are considered as a prospective interconnect material. A comprehensive conductance and delay analysis of {GNR} interconnects is presented in this paper. Using a simple tight-binding model and the linear response Landauer formula, the conductance model of {GNR} is derived. Several {GNR} structures are examined, and the conductance among them and other interconnect materials [e.g., copper (Cu), tungsten (W), and carbon nanotubes ({CNTs)]} is compared. The impact of different model parameters (i.e., bandgap, mean free path, Fermi level, and edge specularity) on the conductance is discussed. Both global and local {GNR} interconnect delays are analyzed using an {RLC} equivalent circuit model. Intercalation doping for multilayer {GNRs} is proposed, and it is shown that in order to match (or better) the performance of Cu or {CNT} bundles at either the global or local level, multiple zigzag-edged {GNR} layers along with proper intercalation doping must be used and near-specular nanoribbon edge should be achieved. However, intercalation-doped multilayer zigzag {GNRs} can have better performance than that of W, implying possible application as local interconnects in some cases. Thus, this paper identifies the on-chip interconnect domains where {GNRs} can be employed and provides valuable insights into the process technology development for {GNR} interconnects.},

Data transfer between power domains needs a cross power domain interface ({CPDI).} The existing level-conversion flip-flop ({LCFF)} structures all need dual power rails, which leads to large area and performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a {CPDI} circuit utilizing monolithic {3D} technology. This interface functions as a flip-flop and provides reliable data conversion from one power domain to another. Our design separates power rails in each tier, substantially reducing physical design complexity and area penalty. The design is implemented in a 45nm low power technology. It shows 20\%-35\% smaller clock to Q and 30\% energy saving comparing with existing {LCFF} designs. The proposed design also shows better robustness with ±10\% voltage variation.},

	abstract = {The complexity of circuit designs has necessitated a top-down approach to layout synthesis. A large body of work shows that a good layout hierarchy, or partitioning tree, as measured by the associated Rent parameter, will correspond to an area-efficient layout. We define the intrinsic Rent parameter of a netlist to be the minimum possible Rent parameter of any partitioning tree for the netlist. Experimental results show that spectra-based ratio cut partitioning algorithms yield partitioning trees with the lowest observed Rent parameter over all benchmarks and over all algorithms tested. For examples where the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, spectral ratio cut partitioning yields a partitioning tree with Rent parameter essentially identical to this theoretical optimum. These results have deep implications with respect to both the choice of partitioning algorithms for top-down layout, as well as new approaches to layout area estimation. The paper concludes with directions for future research, including several promising techniques for fast estimation of the (intrinsic) Rent parameter},

Along the road of interconnect evolution, Network-on-Chips ({NoCs)} have emerged as a structured and scalable solution for connecting computational elements on a very large scale integration chip. Also, with the deep-submicron technology allowing integration of billions of transistors, chips have grown very complex and large in size. The global wire-length problem was addressed with the integration of devices in the third dimension (3-D). The combination of 3-D integration and a scalable interconnect, like {NoCs}, promise to revolutionize design for Chip Multi-processors, System-on-chips, and System-in-package. This paper surveys on all the advancements in 3-D {NoCs.}},

A daisy-chain feature is adopted for the characterization and reliability Assessment. After pattern trace formation, the microbump is fabricated on the trace by an electroplating technique. A suitable barrier/seed layer thickness is designed and applied to minimize the undercut due to wet etching but still achieve good plating uniformity. With the current process, the undercut is less than 1 μm and the bump height variation is less than 10\%. In addition, the shear test is adopted to characterize the bump strength, which exceeds the specification. Also, the Cu-Sn lead-free solder micro bumped chip is bonded on a Si wafer (chip-to-wafer or {C2W} bonding). Furthermore, the micro-gap between the bonded chips is filled with a special underfill. The shear strength of the bonded chips w/o underfill is measured and exceeds the specification. The bonding and filling integrity is further evaluated by open/short measurement, {SAT} analysis, and cross-section with {SEM} analysis. The stacked {ICs} are evaluated by reliability tests, including thermal cycling test (-{55⇆125°C}, dwell and ramp times = 15 min).

	title = {Thin wafer handling process evaluation for {3DIC} integration},
	abstract = {After temporary bonding and thinning process, many backside processes will be conducted on the thinned wafer. The critical processes for thin wafer handling material are high temperature and high vacuum processes. In this article, a quick adhesive selecting method is proposed. Backside process of {PECVD} {SiO2} is identified as the most critical process for thin wafer handling material selection. Two thermal plastic thin wafer handling materials are used in this study for 300 mm wafers and thermal compress bonding in a vacuum chamber is used for bonding process. After bonding, the wafer is thinned down to 50 μm by a commercialized grinder and the {PECVD} {SiO2} process is conducted on the thinned wafer. Many dishes were found after {PECVD} {SiO2} process because there is outgassing from the thin wafer handling material or from the device/carrier wafer surface. In this research, an additional hold time is proposed to reduce the dishing after {PECVD} {SiO2} process. Different hold time at 210 {°C} and different bonding time are evaluated. For the bonding process without hold time, large voids are observed. There are also 29 dishes on the surface of the wafer. By adding additional 5 minutes hold time before bonding, the number of the dishing on the wafer surface reduced from 29 to 6. If the hold time is set to 10 minutes, only 4 dishes were found on the wafer surface. From the evaluation result of these two thermal plastic thin wafer handling materials, B-glue seems much better than A-glue. The hold time seems very critical on void reduction during bonding process. From B-glue on {PECVD} {SiO2} experiment, 10 minutes hold time has the better performance for void reduction. The bonding process with zero hold time has the worst performance which has many voids after {PECVD} {SiO2} process. An ultra-thin 300 mm wafer with a thickness less than 7 μm is also demonstrated in this research by using B-glue and 10- minutes hold time.},

Together with any etching technology the liquid fill technology allows an extremely simple process flow to realize conductor lines inside buried channels. Taking the right material combinations there is very low stress inside the substrate, which allows a high design freedom for larger via or systematic aligned via. Using the fill technology for stacked dies an extremely simple and compact {3D} wiring is possible.

However, because of increased device and current density, the reliability of the 3-D power grid and its integrity must be studied and analyzed. Due to the geometry of {TSVs} and connections to the global power grid, significant current crowding can occur. Current densities at these connections can be much higher than the expected average values, so extra care is required for accurate analysis. In prior work, {TSVs} are modeled as single resistors along with power grid wire segments. Such models do not capture detailed current density distribution and may miss hotspots associated with current crowding. This paper studies current crowding and its impact on 3-D power grid integrity. First, we explore the current density distribution within a {TSV} and its connections to the global chip power grid. Second, we implement simple {TSV} models to obtain current density distributions within a {TSV} and its local environment. These models are checked for accuracy by comparing with models simulated using finite element modeling methods.

	title = {On the Classical Radiation of Accelerated Electrons},
	volume = {75},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the properties of the radiation from a high energy accelerated electron, as recently observed in the General Electric synchrotron. An elementary derivation of the total rate of radiation is first presented, based on Larmor's formula for a slowly moving electron, and arguments of relativistic invariance. We then construct an expression for the instantaneous power radiated by an electron moving along an arbitrary, prescribed path. By casting this result into various forms, one obtains the angular distribution, the spectral distribution, or the combined angular and spectral distributions of the radiation. The method is based on an examination of the rate at which the electron irreversibly transfers energy to the electromagnetic field, as determined by half the difference of retarded and advanced electric field intensities. Formulas are obtained for an arbitrary charge-current distribution and then specialized to a point charge. The total radiated power and its angular distribution are obtained for an arbitrary trajectory. It is found that the direction of motion is a strongly preferred direction of emission at high energies. The spectral distribution of the radiation depends upon the detailed motion over a time interval large compared to the period of the radiation. However, the narrow cone of radiation generated by an energetic electron indicates that only a small part of the trajectory is effective in producing radiation observed in a given direction, which also implies that very high frequencies are emitted. Accordingly, we evaluate the spectral and angular distributions of the high frequency radiation by an energetic electron, in their dependence upon the parameters characterizing the instantaneous orbit. The average spectral distribution, as observed in the synchrotron measurements, is obtained by averaging the electron energy over an acceleration cycle. The entire spectrum emitted by an electron moving with constant speed in a circular path is also discussed. Finally, it is observed that quantum effects will modify the classical results here obtained only at extraordinarily large energies.},

In addition to flat netlist hypergraph, we use user design hierarchy as a hint for partitioning. This design hierarchy already has some implications on connectivity between logical blocks in the design. Using design hierarchy in partitioning is nontrivial since the hierarchical elements in design hierarchy do not necessarily have strong internal connectivity; hence, we need to determine whether it is preferable to break up or preserve the hierarchical elements. In order to identify and select the hierarchical elements with strong connectivity, their Rent exponents are used. Then, the selected hierarchical elements serve as effective clustering scopes during the multilevel coarsening phase. The scopes are dynamically updated (enlarged) while building up a clustering tree so that the clustering tree resembles the densely connected portions of the design hierarchy. We tested our algorithm on a set of large industrial designs in which the largest one has 1.8 million cells, 2.8 million nets, and 11 levels of hierarchy. By exploiting design hierarchy, our algorithm produces higher quality partitioning results than the state-of-the-art multilevel partitioner {hMetis.} Furthermore, experimental results show that dhml yields significantly more stable solutions, which is helpful in practice to reduce the number of runs to obtain the best result.},

The majority of the existing {3D} {IC} research is focused on how to take advantage of the performance, power, smaller form-factor, and heterogeneous integration benefits that offered by {3D} integration. However, all such advantages ultimately have to translate into cost savings when a design strategy has to be decided: Is {3D} integration a cost effective technology for a particular {IC} design? Consequently, system-level cost analysis at the early design stage is imperative to help the decision making on whether {3D} integration should be adopted. In this paper, we study the design estimation method for {3D} {ICs} at the early design stage, and propose a cost analysis model to study the cost implication for {3D} {ICs}, and address the following cost-related problems related to {3D} {IC} design: (1) Do all the benefits of {3D} {IC} design come with a much higher cost?

	issn = {1063-8210},
	abstract = {Computer hardware components have changed significantly since the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and even since the early 1990s. Work concerning Rent's memos prior to the present paper has been based on a 1971 interpretation of two unpublished memoranda written in 1960 by E. F. Rent while working at {IBM}, even though today's computer components are significantly different from those in 1960 and 1971. However, because of the significant changes in the design and implementation of computer hardware components since 1960 and 1971, a new interpretation of Rent's memos is needed for today's components. We have obtained copies of Rent's two memos. In these memos, Rent describes the method that he used to obtain an empirical relationship between properties of the computer hardware components of the {IBM} 1401 and the {IBM} 1410 computers. We have studied these memos carefully in order to understand Rent's original intent. Based on our careful reading of these two memos, the personal knowledge of one of us with the 1401 and 1410 computers, and our experience designing ultralarge-scale integrated ({ULSI)} circuits for high-performance microprocessors, we have derived an historically equivalent interpretation of Rent's memos suitable for today's computer components. The purpose of this paper is to present a new interpretation of the memos and to present an application to wirelength distributions of real {ULSI} circuitry. In this paper, we will: 1) describe the contents of the memos and Rent's method; 2) provide an historically-equivalent interpretation of Rent's memos for today's computer components; and 3) apply this new interpretation to real {ULSI} control logic circuitry in the 1.3-{GHz} {IBM} {POWER4} microprocessor. In this paper, we will show that this new interpretation of the two memos provides improved wirelength distribution models with better qualitative agreement with measurements and more accurate estimates of wirelength distributions and wirelength requirements for real {ULSI} d esigns compared with prior methods.},

The comparison reveals that brain connectivity is in good agreement with Rent’s rule. However, the known network topologies fall short of being strong contenders for mimicking brain’s connectivity. That is why we perform a detailed Rent-based (top-down) connectivity analysis of generic two-layer hierarchical network topologies. This analysis aims to identify generic two-layer hierarchical network topologies which could closely mimic brain’s connectivity. The range of granularities (i.e., number of gates/cores/neurons) where such mimicking is possible are identified and discussed. These results should have implications for the design of future networks-on-chip in general, and for the burgeoning field of multi/many-core processors in particular (in the medium term), as well as for forward-looking investigations on emerging brain-inspired nano-architectures (in the long run).},

In practice, only a very small number of passes are typically needed, leading to a fast approximation algorithm for mincut partitioning. To deal with cells of various sizes, the algorithm progresses by moving one cell at a time between the blocks of the partition while maintaining a desired balance based on the size of the blocks rather than the number of cells per block. Efficient data structures are used to avoid unnecessary searching for the best cell to move and to minimize unnecessary updating of cells affected by each move.},

Besides, it is commonly cited as a means of reducing lateral wirelength. Some early theoretical and experimental studies have also shown that 3-D {IC} can significantly reduce lateral wirelength. However, the effect of through-silicon via ({TSV)} area overhead on the wirelength has been largely overlooked.

Therefore, studies on the performance and optimization of carbon-based interconnects working in a realistic operational environment are needed in order to advance the technology beyond the exploratory discovery phase. In this paper, we present the first demonstration of graphene interconnects monolithically integrated with industry-standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, as well as the first experimental results that compare the performance of high-speed on-chip graphene and {MWCNT} interconnects. The graphene interconnects operate up to 1.3-{GHz} frequency, which is a speed that is commensurate with the fastest high-speed processor chips today.

We briefly describe the most fundamental characters of organic semiconductors and {OFETs}, which set the bottom line dictating the requirement of an original model different from that of conventional inorganic devices. Along with an introduction to the principles of compact modeling for circuit simulation, a comparative analysis of the reported models is presented with an emphasis on their primary assumptions and applicability aspects.

The boundary condition analysis also points the way to modeling cavity pressure correctly in more complicated and realistic cases. The zero cavity size limit of the analytical solution is interesting because it shows, contrary to common belief, that a cavity is not necessary for the existence of very high internal pressures to cause mechanical damage.},

However, when deciding to adopt this emerging technology as a mainstream design approach, designers must consider the cost of {3D} integration. {IC} testing is a key factor that affects the final product cost, and it could be a major portion of the total {IC} cost. In {3D} {IC} design, various testing strategies and different integration methods could affect the final product cost dramatically, and the interaction with other cost factors could result in various trade-offs. This paper develops a comprehensive and parameterized testing cost model for {3D} {IC} integration, and analyzes the trade-offs associated with testing strategies and testing circuit overheads. With the proposed testing cost model, designers can explore the most cost-effective integration and testing strategies for {3D} {IC} chips.},

It is proved that the problem reduces to the minimization of a sum or r positive semi-definite quadratic forms which, under the quadratic constraints, reduces to the problem of finding r eigenvectors of a special “disconnection” matrix.

	abstract = {Three methods have been proposed to test Through-Silicon-Vias ({TSV)} electrically prior to {3D} integration. These test methods are (1) sense amplification; (2) leakage current monitor; and (3) capacitance bridge methods. These tests are aimed at detecting one or both of two failure types, pin-holes and voids. The test circuits measure capacitance and leakage current of the {TSVs}, and generate a 1 bit pass/fail signal. The outputs are streamed out through a scan chain. The test time is 10 μs for the leakage test and the sense amplification methods, and is 15 μs for the capacitive bridge method. All these methods can be implemented for test-before-stacking, which will increase assembled yield. Resolution, power and area of these {TSV} test circuits were compared. The performance of each circuit was studied at {PVT} corners. The {IMEC} {TSV} technology was assumed, and the designs were simulated using the 32 nm predicted device model. Without any failure, the {TSV} capacitance’s mean value is 37 {fF}, and its leakage resistance is higher than 850 MΩ. With respect to 37 {fF} standard capacitance, resolution for the sense amplification method is 3.3 {fF} (8.9\%); it is 0.16 {fF} (0.4\%) for the capacitance bridge method. Although the capacitance bridge method has relatively better resolution, it takes 4x area and 10x power than the other two, and is also more sensitive to {PVT} variation. Resolution of the leakage current monitor method is 10 MΩ (1.1\%) with respect to its threshold 850 MΩ, and use {42.5aJ} power in normal case. Sense amplification circuit can be modified to detect equivalent leakage resistance under {2KΩ.}},

	abstract = {Spectral partitioning methods use the Fiedler vector-the eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix-to find a small separator of a graph. These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While active spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(√n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n1d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n2d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes},

	abstract = {Three-Dimensional ({3D)} Integrated Circuits ({ICs)} that integrate die with Through-Silicon Vias ({TSVs)} promise to continue system and functionality scaling beyond the traditional geometric {2D} device scaling. {3D} integration also improves the performance of {ICs} by reducing the communication time between different chip components through the use of short {TSV-based} vertical wires. This reduction is particularly attractive in processors where it is desirable to reduce the access time between the main logic die and the L2 cache or the main memory die. Process variations in {2D} {ICs} lead to a drop in parametric yield (as measured by speed, leakage and sales profits), which forces manufacturers to speed bin their chips and to sell slow chips at reduced prices. In this paper we develop a model to quantify the impact of process variations on the parametric yield of {3D} {ICs}, and then we propose a number of integration strategies that use a graph-theoretic framework to maximize the performance, parametric yield and profits of {3D} {ICs.} Comparing our proposed strategies to current yield-oblivious methods, it is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the number of {3D} {ICs} in the fastest speed bins by almost 2×, while simultaneously reducing the number of slow {ICs} by 29.4\%. This leads to an improvement in performance by up to 6.45\% and an increase of about 12.48\% in total sales revenue using up-to-date market price models.},

	abstract = {To harness the full potential of 3-D integrated circuits, analysis tools for early design space exploration are needed. Such tools, targeting multiple design facets and cost trade-off analysis, would allow designers to arrive at major decisions regarding architecture and implementations fabrics. We focus in this paper on the efficient estimation of on-chip power delivery requirements consistent with supply noise limits. We propose a number of algorithms to find the minimum number of through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} that deliver power with acceptable {IR} drops. Minimizing the number of {TSVs} reduces the total silicon die area which is the main recurring cost during fabrication. To compute the {TSV} requirements realistically, we utilize power traces derived from benchmark-based functional behavior of processors. To speed-up our simulations, we develop a trace selection technique that utilizes the relevant portion of power traces representing the worst load for {IR} drops. The trace selection scheme reduces the number of simulations by 51×. Using these traces we find the best spatial allocation of {TSVs} for a 3-D implementation of a processor. The iterative algorithm can be run in approximately one hour on a 40-processor cluster.},

	abstract = {Three methods have been proposed to test Through-Silicon-Vias ({TSV)} electrically prior to {3D} integration. These test methods are (1) sense amplification; (2) leakage current monitor; and (3) capacitance bridge methods. These tests are aimed at detecting one or both of two failure types, pin-holes and voids. The test circuits measure capacitance and leakage current of the {TSVs}, and generate a 1 bit pass/fail signal. The outputs are streamed out through a scan chain. The test time is 10 μs for the leakage test and the sense amplification methods, and is 15 μs for the capacitive bridge method. All these methods can be implemented for test-before-stacking, which will increase assembled yield. Resolution, power and area of these {TSV} test circuits were compared. The performance of each circuit was studied at {PVT} corners. The {IMEC} {TSV} technology was assumed, and the designs were simulated using the 32 nm predicted device model. Without any failure, the {TSV} capacitance's mean value is 37 {fF}, and its leakage resistance is higher than 850 M¿. With respect to 37 {fF} standard capacitance, resolution for the sense amplification method is 3.3 {fF} (8.9\%); it is 0.16 {fF} (0.4\%) for the capacitance bridge method. Although the capacitance bridge method has relatively better resolution, it takes 4x area and 10x power than the other two, and is also more sensitive to {PVT} variation. Resolution of the leakage current monitor method is 10 M¿ (1.1\%) with respect to its threshold 850 M¿, and use {42.5aJ} power in normal case. Sense amplification circuit can be modified to detect equivalent leakage resistance under {2K¿.}},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the linear placement problem by using a spectral approach. It has been demonstrated that, by giving a more accurate representation of the linear placement problem, a linear objective function yields better placement quality in terms of wire length than a quadratic objective function as in the eigenvector approach [4][11][6]. On the other hand, the quadratic objective function has an advantage in that it tends to place components more sparsely than the linear objective function, resulting in a continuous solution closer to a physically feasible discrete solution. In this paper, we propose an α-order objective function to capture the strengths of both the linear and quadratic objective functions. We demonstrate that our approach yields improved spectral placements. We also present a bottom-up clustering algorithm which iteratively collapses pairs of nodes in a graph using local and global connectivity information, where the global connectivity information is derived from the clustering property of the eigenvector approach. The effect of our new spectral linear placement and clustering approach is demonstrated on benchmark circuits from {MCNC}},

In order to achieve the high energy storage required for power management, on-chip inductors require relatively thick magnetic yoke materials (several microns or more), which can be readily deposited by electroplating through a photoresist mask as demonstrated in this paper, the yoke material of choice being {Ni45Fe55}, whose properties of relatively high moment and electrical resistivity make it an attractive model yoke material for inductors. Inductors were designed with a variety of yoke geometries, and included both single-turn and multi-turn coil designs, which were fabricated on 200 mm silicon wafers in a {CMOS} back-end-of-line ({BEOL)} facility. Each inductor consisted of electroplated copper coils enclosed by the electroplated {Ni45Fe55} yokes; aspects of the fabrication of the inductors are discussed. Magnetic properties of the electroplated yoke materials are described, including high frequency permeability measurements. The inductance of 2-turn coil inductors, for example, was enhanced up to about 6 times over the air core equivalent, with an inductance density of 130 {nH/mm2} being achieved. The resistance of these non-laminated inductors was relatively large at high frequency due to magnetic and eddy current losses but is expected to improve as the yoke material/structure is further optimized, making electroplated yoke-containing inductors attractive for dc-dc power converters.},

	abstract = {Over the years, different interpretations of Rent's rule and different ways of estimating the Rent parameters have emerged. In general, these parameters are extracted from the average terminal-gate relationship for a set of circuit modules. We show that this relationship (the Rent characteristic) strongly depends on the definition of the circuit modules. These can be generated in many different ways, either from the topology of the circuit graph or, in a geometric way, by cutting regions from a circuit layout. The resulting Rent parameters can be quite far apart. This paper discusses the fundamental differences between the topological and the two geometric interpretations of the Rent characteristic that are expected to be most appropriate for current wirelength estimation techniques. Our discussion is based on experimental data, as well as on a theoretical model that can be used to estimate certain geometric Rent characteristics from the topological Rent parameters. Using this model, we derive a theoretical lower limit to the value of the average geometric Rent exponent. We also study the impact of the placement approach and placement quality on the geometric Rent characteristics.},

	abstract = {In this paper, physical models are derived for the effective resistance of multilayer graphene nanoribbon (m-{GNR)} interconnects. The impact of finite resistive coupling between the layers for top contacted m-{GNR} interconnects is considered. It is found that the addition of more parallel layers does not necessarily translate into a decrease in the overall resistance of m-{GNR} interconnects. Rather, the improvement in the effective resistance saturates with an increase in the number of layers. The optimal number of layers to minimize the delay and the energy-delay product of m-{GNR} interconnects is also evaluated. It is found that the optimal number of layers is a function of the interconnect length, interlayer resistance, and the kind of contact that is used. It is demonstrated that, for short interconnect lengths, m-{GNR} interconnects with smooth edges perform better compared to copper wires.},

Large landing pads, however, could lead to metal density mismatch problems, which result in nonuniform topography.

	volume = {17},
	issn = {1063-8210},
	abstract = {A statistical performance simulator is developed to explore the impact of parameter variations on the maximum clock frequency ({FMAX)} and throughput distributions of multi-core processors in a future 22 nm technology. The simulator captures the effects of die-to-die ({D2D)} and within-die ({WID)} transistor and interconnect parameter variations on critical path delays in a die. A key component of the simulator is an analytical multi-core processor throughput model, which enables computationally efficient and accurate throughput calculations, as compared with cycle-accurate performance simulators, for single-threaded and highly parallel multi-threaded ({MT)} workloads. Based on microarchitecture designs from previous microprocessors, three multi-core processors with either small, medium, or large cores are projected for the 22 nm technology generation to investigate a range of design options. These three multi-core processors are optimized for maximum throughput within a constant die area. A traditional single-core processor is also scaled to the 22 nm technology to provide a baseline comparison. The salient contributions from this paper are: 1) product-level variation analysis for multi-core processors must focus on throughput, rather than just {FMAX}, and 2) multi-core processors are more variation tolerant than single-core processors due to the larger impact of memory latency and bandwidth on throughput. To elucidate these two points, statistical simulations indicate that multi-core and single-core processors with an equivalent total core area have similar {FMAX} distributions (mean degradation of 9\% and standard deviation of 5\%) for {MT} applications. In contrast to single-core processors, memory latency and bandwidth constraints significantly limit the throughput dependency on {FMAX} in multi-core processors, thus reducing the throughput mean degradation and standard deviation by 50\% for the small and medium core designs and by 30\% for the large core design. This impr- - ovement in the throughput distribution indicates that multi-core processors could significantly reduce the product design and process development complexities due to parameter variations as compared to single-core processors, enabling faster time to market for high-performance microprocessor products.},

	abstract = {The topics of {3D-IC} packages are now widely studied around the world in recent years, not only in electronic packaging areas, but also in bioengineering areas and so on. With the developments of {3D-ICs} technologies, packaging effects on {3D-ICs} of Cu/low-k interconnects have become a critical reliability issue, especially in the assembly processes and reliability test procedures. In {3D-IC} packages, low-k dielectrics are now popularly used to retard the {RC} delayed effects, increase the bandwidth, reduce the inductance and decrease the power consumption. By using the weaker low-k dielectrics instead of traditional {TEOS} interlevel dielectrics, packaging induced interfacial delamination in low-k interconnects has been widely observed that raising serious reliability concerns for Cu/low-k chips. In this paper, the thermal induced stresses of Cu/low-k interconnect in {3D-IC} structures during reliability test process are obtained by three-dimensional finite element analysis. The packaging induced crack in Cu/low-k structures is also studied. The results show that the interfacial cracks in {3D-ICs} significantly impact the distribution of thermal induced stresses in Cu/low-k structures and could have prominent influence on their reliability},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method that can characterize the propagation delays across the Through Silicon Vias ({TSVs)} in a {3D} {IC.} We adopt the concept of the oscillation test, in which two {TSVs} are connected with some peripheral circuit to form an oscillation ring. Upon this foundation, we propose a technique called sensitivity analysis to further derive the propagation delay of each individual {TSV} participating in the oscillation ring-a distilling process. In this process, we perturb the strength of the two {TSV} drivers, and then measure their effects in terms of the change of the oscillation ring's period. By some following analysis, the propagation delay of each {TSV} can be revealed. Monte-Carlo analysis of a typical {TSV} with 30\% process variation on transistors shows that the characterization error of this method is only 2.1\% with the standard deviation of 8.1\%.},

	abstract = {Three-Dimensional ({3D)} Integrated Circuits ({ICs)} that integrate die with Through-Silicon Vias ({TSVs)} promise to continue system and functionality scaling beyond the traditional geometric {2D} device scaling. {3D} integration also improves the performance of {ICs} by reducing the communication time between different chip components through the use of short {TSV-based} vertical wires. This reduction is particularly attractive in processors where it is desirable to reduce the access time between the main logic die and the L2 cache or the main memory die. Process variations in {2D} {ICs} lead to a drop in parametric yield (as measured by speed, leakage and sales profits), which forces manufacturers to speed bin their chips and to sell slow chips at reduced prices. In this paper we develop a model to quantify the impact of process variations on the parametric yield of {3D} {ICs}, and then we propose a number of integration strategies that use a graph-theoretic framework to maximize the performance, parametric yield and profits of {3D} {ICs.} Comparing our proposed strategies to current yield-oblivious methods, it is demonstrated that it is possible to increase the number of {3D} {ICs} in the fastest speed bins by almost 2×, while simultaneously reducing the number of slow {ICs} by 29.4\%. This leads to an improvement in performance by up to 6.45\% and an increase of about 12.48\% in total sales revenue using up-to-date market price models.},

	abstract = {In this study, we used a chip-on-chip test vehicle with 30μm pitch lead-free solder micro bump to study the electromigration reliability of solder micro bump interconnection used for {3D} chip stacking. The structure of micro bump composed of {Sn2.5Ag} solder material with {Cu/Ni} under bump metallization ({UBM)} was selected. Two types of interconnection were chosen to evaluate the effect of the joint structure on electromigration behavior. The type I was the chip stacking sample with the {IMC} / Sn (5 um thick) / {IMC} joint structure, while the type {II} was the sample with fully transformed {Ni3Sn4} intermetallic ({IMC)} joints made by the post-treatment of long time thermal aging. Electromigration test was performed on the four point Kelvin structure and daisy-chain structure under the current stressing of 104 105 A/cm2 at an ambient temperature of {150°C.} During the electromigration test, the resistance increase was in-situ monitored to determine the definite time to failure. The microstructure evolution was also examined at different stages of joint resistance increase. From the testing results, the rapid increase of joint resistance was found at the early stage under current stressing in the type I micro bump. After that, the joint resistance increase became slower. This mild increasing stage was much longer than the early stage. For the type {II} sample, however, the resistance increasing rate was quiet lower than that of the type I sample at the identical testing time. With a higher current density in the order of 105 A/cm2 in the micro joint, the effect of joule heating caused the damage happened in Al trace and Cu {UBM} while the residual Sn solder had been transformed to be {Ni3Sn4} {IMC} totally and few voids were found around {IMC} by the microstructure observation. When applied a current density in the order of 104 A/cm2 on the micro joint, the- - residual Sn was also fully transformed to be {IMC.} However, the failure mode of the micro joint is not clear yet because the experiments are still on-going. The resistance variation is showing a steady state under such a condition of current stressing and so far no open failure happened.},

	abstract = {The variability of the poly silicon thin film transistor ({TFT)} in {3D} {NAND} Flash is a major concern. In this work, we have fabricated and characterized a 37.5nm half pitch {3D} Vertical Gate ({VG)} {NAND} Flash, and successfully modeled the random grain boundary effect using {TCAD} simulation. In our model, the grain boundary creates interface states, resulting in large local band bending and a surface potential barrier. The gate-induced grain barrier lowering ({GIGBL)} and drain-induced grain barrier lowering ({DIGBL)} effects are the major physical mechanisms that affect the subthreshold behavior. By means of modeling, the impact of bit line ({BL)} and word line ({WL)} critical dimensions ({CD)} of the double-gate {TFT} device is studied extensively, where we find that narrower {BL} and larger {WL} {CD's} are the most critical parameters that provide tight Vt distribution and good memory window. For the first time, we have discovered an asymmetry of reverse read ({RR)} and forward read ({FR)} of the {TFT} device. The physical mechanism can be well explained by the {DIGBL.} With accurate modeling, the asymmetry of {RR} and {FR} can be used to determine the {GB} trap lateral location and interface trap density.},

	abstract = {{3D} integration is an emerging technology that allows for the vertical stacking of multiple silicon die. These stacked die are tightly integrated with through-silicon vias and promise significant power and area reductions by replacing long global wires with short vertical connections. This technology necessitates that neighboring logical blocks exist on different layers in the stack. However, such functional partitions disable intra-chip communication pre-bond and thus disrupt traditional test techniques. Previous work has described a general test architecture that enables pre-bond testability of an architecturally partitioned {3D} processor and provided mechanisms for basic layer functionality. This work proposes new test methods for designs partitioned at the circuits level,in which the gates and transistors of individual circuits could be split across multiple die layers. We investigated a bit-partitioned adder unit and a port-split register file, which represents the most difficult circuit-partitioned design to test pre-bond but which is used widely in many circuits. Two layouts of each circuit, planar and {3D}, are produced. Our experiments verify the performance and power results and examine the test coverage achieved.},

The central idea underlying a defect tolerant configurable system is to build the system out of partially perfect components, detect the defects and configure the available good resources using software. In this paper we discuss implications of defect tolerance on power area, delay and other relevant parameters for computing architectures. We present a Rent's rule based abstraction of testing for {VLSI} systems and evaluate the redundancy requirements for observability. It is shown that for a very high interconnect defect density, a prohibitively large number of redundant components are necessary for observability and this has adverse affect on the system performance. Through a unified framework based on a priori wire length estimation and Rent's rule we illustrate the hidden cost of supporting such an architecture.},

To characterize the transient dynamic responses of the package, {ANSYS/LS-DYNA} incorporated with the Input-G method is applied. To well simulate the mechanical behaviors of the solder interconnects, a strain-rate-dependent elastoplastic {Johnson–Cook} constitutive model for the {Sn3.5Ag} solder is applied. In addition, an inverse calculation is carried out to identify the overall structural damping of the dynamic system. Furthermore, a {JEDEC-compliant} drop tester is used to conduct the drop test, where failure analysis is performed using an optical microscope. Moreover, a simplified Darveaux fatigue life prediction model is constructed based on the calculated strain energy densities at different {JEDEC} test conditions together with the corresponding drop test data. To demonstrate the validity of the developed fatigue life prediction model, a confirmatory experiment is performed. Finally, parametric {FE} study incorporated with experimental design is performed to seek a design guideline for enhanced solder interconnect reliability under drop impact. Both the experimental and simulation data reveal that underfill can greatly enhance the drop impact reliability of the solder interconnects. In addition, the cornered interconnects and even package in a one-component configuration would fail earlier than the central ones, with a cohesive fracture in the {Sn3.5Ag} solder rather than the intermetallic compound ({IMC)} and its interface. Besides, an increasing {IMC} thickness reduces the drop impact solder interconnect reliability while enhancing the thermal cycling one.},

We extend the range of spectral clustering by developing a general framework for fast approximate spectral clustering in which a distortion-minimizing local transformation is first applied to the data. This framework is based on a theoretical analysis that provides a statistical characterization of the effect of local distortion on the mis-clustering rate. We develop two concrete instances of our general framework, one based on local k-means clustering ({KASP)} and one based on random projection trees ({RASP).} Extensive experiments show that these algorithms can achieve significant speedups with little degradation in clustering accuracy. Specifically, our algorithms outperform k-means by a large margin in terms of accuracy, and run several times faster than approximate spectral clustering based on the Nystrom method, with comparable accuracy and significantly smaller memory footprint. Remarkably, our algorithms make it possible for a single machine to spectral cluster data sets with a million observations within several minutes.},

Some 2?3 layer pristine graphene platelets temporally solvated with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ({NMP)} are assembled at the surface of a dilute aqueous suspension using an evaporation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor instability and then are driven together by Marangoni forces. The platelets are fixed through physical binding of their edges. Typically, 8-cm-diameter circular graphene films are generated within two minutes. Once formed, the films can be transferred onto various substrates with flat or textured topologies.

Using physical circuit models for {SWNTs} and {MWNTs}, it is demonstrated that by the end of the {ITRS} the proposed approach can improve the sheet resistance of power interconnects by up to 3 times, improve the speed of local signal interconnects by 50\%, and lower their dynamic power dissipation by more than two times. In the first interconnect level, a hybrid system of power copper wires and thin {SWNT} signal interconnects would offer the same improvements for signal interconnects and allow utilizing thick copper wires with no performance or power penalties for signal interconnects. At the global levels, it is shown a minimum density of 1 metallic {SWNT} per 2.5 nm2 cross-sectional area is needed to outperform copper power interconnects. Power grids made out of {MWNTs} can offer smaller resistances compared to copper grids only if very coarse grids with grid pitches larger than 20 mum are needed.},

Here we demonstrate the capability to take full advantage of the attractive capabilities of nanowire nanoelectronic devices for long term physiological studies by passivating the nanowire elements with ultrathin metal oxide shells. Studies of Si and Si/aluminum oxide ({Al2O3)} core/shell nanowires in physiological solutions at 37 {°C} demonstrate long-term stability extending for at least 100 days in samples coated with 10 nm thick {Al2O3} shells. In addition, investigations of nanowires configured as field-effect transistors ({FETs)} demonstrate that the {Si/Al2O3} core/shell nanowire {FETs} exhibit good device performance for at least 4 months in physiological model solutions at 37 {°C.} The generality of this approach was also tested with in studies of {Ge/Si} and {InAs} nanowires, where {Ge/Si/Al2O3} and {InAs/Al2O3} core/shell materials exhibited stability for at least 100 days in physiological model solutions at 37 {°C.} In addition, investigations of hafnium oxide-{Al2O3} nanolaminated shells indicate the potential to extend nanowire stability well beyond 1 year time scale in vivo. These studies demonstrate that straightforward core/shell nanowire nanoelectronic devices can exhibit the long term stability needed for a range of chronic in vivo studies in animals as well as powerful biomedical implants that could improve monitoring and treatment of disease.},

This area overhead, which in turn affects the wirelength, worsens due to the large size of {TSVs} themselves, which is shown to be as large as logic gates themselves. Moreover, the capacitive coupling among {TSVs} and wires cause non-negligible amount of parasitic capacitance, which worsens power consumption.

By comparing mismatch values of thin- and thick-oxide {nMOS}, we found that factors, which do not scale with gate oxide thickness, including line edge roughness and metal-gate granularity ({MGG)}, can explain \$sim60\%\$ of total mismatch of thin-oxide devices. Moreover, we report a convex shape of threshold voltage mismatch following the increase of the number of {FINs} and propose a possible explanation of the abnormal behavior. Due to channel width quantization, two competing contributors impact mismatch: as {FIN} number becomes smaller mismatch due to {MGG} likely play an important role which increases threshold voltage mismatch, whereas {FIN} number becomes larger, systematic variation becomes the main factor, which also increases threshold voltage mismatch.},

In this paper we show that a simple spectral algorithm can solve all three problems above in the average case, as well as a more general problem of partitioning graphs based on edge density. In nearly all cases our approach meets or exceeds previous parameters, while introducing substantial generality. We apply spectral techniques, using foremost the observation that in all of these problems, the expected adjacency matrix is a low rank matrix wherein the structure of the solution is evident.},

	abstract = {Microprocessor performance has been improving at roughly 60\% per year. Memory access times, however, have improved by less than 10\% per year. The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how {3D} {IC} technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional {IC} technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins. The principal challenge remains the demonstration of a highly manufacturable {3D} {IC} technology with high yield and low cost.},

	abstract = {Interconnects are considered as one of the grandest challenges that gigascale and terascale integrations face because of the delay they add to critical paths, the power they dissipate, the noise and jitter they induce on one another, and their vulnerability to electromigration. Recent studies on novel computational state variables such as electron spin have demonstrated that interconnects will continue to be an ever-growing challenge, even for post-complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS)} switches. The novel 2-D carbon-based material graphene has demonstrated remarkable electrical properties that make it a viable candidate to implement interconnects in both electrical and spintronic domains. In this paper, physical models of the electron transport parameters such as electron mean free path ({MFP)}, diffusion coefficient, mobility, and resistance per unit length are presented for both bulk (2-D) and narrow (1-D) graphene nanoribbons ({GNRs)} as a function of the interconnect dimensions, edge roughness, and Fermi-energy shift. The potential of multilayer {GNR} ({ML-GNR)} as electrical interconnects is explored by taking into account the finite interlayer resistivity between the multiple layers within the {ML-GNR} stack. The spin-relaxation length in graphene is obtained using some theoretical estimates on the spin-orbit coupling ({SOC)} introduced due to ripples in graphene. It is found that, in pure graphene, the spin-relaxation length could be longer than 10 μm; however, the presence of adatoms limits the spin-relaxation length in graphene to only 1-2 μm at room temperature. The models developed in this paper are used to benchmark graphene interconnects against their conventional copper/low- κ interconnects in both electrical and spintronic domains. The results offer important insights about the advantages and limitations of graphene interconnects and provide guidelines for technology development for this emerging interconnect technology.},

Beginning with the virtual source model, a model for nanoscale {MOSFETs} expressed in traditional form, we show how the Landauer approach gives a clear physical interpretation to the parameters in the model. The analysis shows that transport in the channel is limited by diffusion near the virtual source both below and above threshold, that the current saturation is determined by velocity saturation near the source, not by the maximum velocity in the channel, and that the channel resistance approaches a finite value as the channel length approaches zero. These results help explain why traditional models continue to work well at the nanoscale, even though carrier transport is distinctly different from that at the microscale, and they identify the essential physics that physics-based compact models for nanoscale {MOSFETs} should comprehend.},

The phasor method is a mathematical method for solving linear sinusoidal steady-state circuits and time-varying electromagnetic fields. This paper traces the history and diffusion of the phasor method in the discipline of electrical engineering in China. In 1914, Sidney Roby Sheldon, an American teacher at the Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry, Shanghai, China, introduced the phasor method to his students in his Alternating Currents course. The textbook used was Elements of Electrical Engineering (Volume {II)} by William Suddards Franklin and William Esty. In 1920, The Electrical Magazine published a paper {“Complex} number and its application” by Sijiu Shi (editor of the electrical engineering section of this periodical). This is the earliest example found of Chinese literature introducing the phasor method. In the 1930s, Principles of Alternating Currents, an American electrical engineering textbook that includes the phasor method, was translated by Chinese scholars; this Chinese version promoted the use of the phasor method in China's electrical engineering field. Alternating Current Circuits, authored by the Chinese university professor Pen Tung Sah and published in 1948, may be the earliest example of the phasor method being included in a Chinese electrical engineering textbook; it played an important role in popularizing the phasor method in China.},

Using the method called µ-Czochralski process and {LPCVD} a-Si precursor film, two layers of the {SG} Si {TFT} layers with the grains having a diameter of 6µm were vertically stacked with a maximum process temperature of 550{\textless}I{\textgreater}°{\textless}{/I{\textgreater}C.} Mobility for electrons and holes were 600cm{\textless}{SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}/Vs} and 200cm{\textless}{SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}/Vs}, respectively.

This effect has been widely utilized in particle separation and energy harvesting, where the charge transfer is preferred to be maximized. However, this effect is always undesirable in some areas such as electronic circuit systems due to the damage from the accumulated electrostatic charges. Herein, we introduced an approach to purposely manipulate the contact electrification process both in polarity and magnitude of the charge transfer through an applied electric field between two materials. Theoretical modeling and the corresponding experiments for controlling the charge transfer between a Pt coated atomic force microscopy tip and Parylene film have been demonstrated. The modulation effect of the electric field on contact electrification is enhanced for a thinner dielectric layer. This work can potentially be utilized to enhance the output performance of energy harvesting devices or nullify contact electric charge transfer in applications where this effect is undesirable.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a review of both Rent's rule and the placement models derived from it. It is proposed that the power-law form of Rent's rule, which predicts the number of terminals required by a group of gates for communication with the rest of the circuit, is a consequence of a statistically homogeneous circuit topology and gate placement. The term "homogeneous" is used to imply that quantities such as the average wire length per gate and the average number of terminals per gate are independent of the position within the circuit. Rent's rule is used to derive a variety of net length distribution models and the approach adopted in this paper is to factor the distribution function into the product of an occupancy probability distribution and a function which represents the number of valid net placement sites. This approach places diverse placement models under a common framework and allows the errors introduced by the modeling process to be isolated and evaluated. Models for both planar and hierarchical gate placement are presented.},

	title = {{TSV-aware} analytical placement for {3D} {IC} designs},
	abstract = {Through-silicon vias ({TSVs)} are required for transmitting signals among different dies for the three-dimensional integrated circuit ({3D} {IC)} technology. The significant silicon areas occupied by {TSVs} bring critical challenges for {3D} {IC} placement. Unlike most published {3D} placement works that only minimize the number of {TSVs} during placement due to the limitations in their techniques, this paper proposes a new {3D} cell placement algorithm which can additionally consider the sizes of {TSVs} and the physical positions for {TSV} insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of three stages: (1) {3D} analytical global placement with density optimization and whitespace reservation for {TSVs}, (2) {TSV} insertion and {TSV-aware} legalization, and (3) layer-by-layer detailed placement. In particular, the global placement is based on a novel weighted-average wirelength model, giving the first model in the literature that can outperform the well-known log-sum-exp wirelength model theoretically and empirically. Further, {3D} routing can easily be accomplished by traditional {2D} routers since the physical positions of {TSVs} are determined during placement. Compared with state-of-the-art {3D} cell placement works, our algorithm can achieve the best routed wirelength, {TSV} counts, and total silicon area, in shortest running time.},

Data from (100)-oriented undoped-body extremely thin silicon-on-insulator {FETs} with neutral stress liners are used to validate the method.

Evaluating the economic efficiency of test operations in the interposer-based {3D} {IC} thus is important. We propose a cost model for the Die-to-Wafer ({D2W)} and Die-to-Die ({D2D)} stacking, including manufacturing cost and test cost. A tool which is based on the proposed cost model is developed. We use this tool for cost analysis and for finding the most cost effective test flow. The results show that, in some applications, test flows including the iterative known-good stack ({KGS)} test and the pre-bond interposer test significantly reduce the cost, when the {KGS} test yield is lower than 98.2\% and the pre-bond interposer test yield is lower than 99.38\%. A Shmoo plot is depicted to show the lower bound of the yield of the final package level test, given the number of stacked dies and the final yield. For different applications, the proposed model evaluates the critical yield or cost values, which helps the designers to determine the most cost effective test flow and the system architecture.},

Accordingly, new engineering degrees, adapted to the goals of the Bologna Declaration or {ABET} criteria, consider presentation skills as being fundamental transferable skills. In practice, however, many engineering degree programs do not specifically foster these skills even though they are included in the syllabus. This paper proposes a presentation-skills training that uses the Master's thesis as an opportunity for fostering presentation-related skills. This activity has students deliver a scheduled series of rehearsals, in front of their classmates and tutors, for their officially assessed presentation of their Master's thesis work. The paper also presents a Web tool specifically designed for uploading recordings of the rehearsal presentations for feedback online as a complementary method for fostering presentation-related skills. Finally, the results of carrying out the proposed resource over a 4-year period from 2009 to 2013 are discussed; they show that students following the proposed methodology had higher than average marks, all receiving an A+, and 82\% of them receiving an A+ with distinction.},

A wide variety of clustering schemes have been proposed, including random walks, iterative matching, and fairly complicated spectral techniques.

Our algorithm first computes a d-digit code for each module vi according to the signs of the ith entries in a set of d eigenvectors. Then, modules with the same code are assigned to the same cluster. Despite its simplicity, this new clustering algorithm is strongly motivated by theoretical results for both spectral bipartitioning and multi-dimensional vector partitioning. The algorithm also has linear time complexity (not including the eigenvector computation) and is at least as effective as previous clustering algorithms in terms of two-phase Fiduccia-Mattheyses bipartitioning},

	abstract = {Rent's rule can be derived by direct partitioning of the circuit netlist, by indirect partitioning of the placed layout, or by averaging the number of terminals for various equally large regions of the placed circuit. It is shown that all three methods may produce different results. After investigation of the fundamental reasons for these differences, three distinct effects can be identified. The boundary and the embedding effect is present with all placement approaches, though the embedding effect may be (partly) nullified by the grid effect that may occur with some partitioning-based placement {algorithms.One} of the main applications of Rent's rule is the estimation of wire length distribution. Both flat and hierarchical placement models can be applied, though experiments show that for the current state-of-the-art estimation techniques the latter produces better results, even for layouts that were generated using a flat placement approach. Which Rent parameters and occupation probability function should be used depends on the placement algorithm. We discuss various possibilities and present a new occupation probability function that allows better wire length estimations of partitioning-based placements.},

All structures have {X,Y} lateral scaling limitation since the minimal {ONO} thickness ( 20 nm) and poly channel thickness ( 10nm) can not be scaled further. Among them {VG} may have the best X-direction scalability to F {2X} nm node, and no penalty of increasing Z layer number since the channel current flows horizontally. We propose a buried-channel junction-free {NAND} to improve the read current for all {3D} {NAND} arrays and our simulation results well support this structure. For the first time, {“Z-interference”} in {3D} {NAND} Flash is examined and it indicates a new Z-direction scaling limitation. The present work is of crucial importance in understanding various {3D} {NAND} Flash approaches.},

This area overhead, which in turn affects the wirelength, worsens due to the large size of {TSVs} themselves, which is shown to be as large as logic gates themselves. Moreover, the capacitive coupling among {TSVs} and wires cause non-negligible amount of parasitic capacitance, which worsens power consumption.

We review our recent achievements in monolithic {3D-ICs} based on single-grain Si {TFTs} that are fabricated inside a single-grain with a low-temperature process. With the μ-Czochralski process based on a pulsed-laser crystallization, Si grains with a diameter of 6 μm are successfully formed on predetermined positions. Single-grain ({SG)} Si {TFTs} are fabricated inside the single-grain with mobility for electron and holes of 600 {cm2/V} s and 200 {cm2/V} s, respectively. Two layers of the {SG} Si {TFT} were vertically stacked and successfully implemented into {CMOS} inverter, {3D} {6T-SRAM} and single-grain lateral {PIN} photo-diode with in-pixel amplifier. Those results indicate that the {SG} {TFTs} are attractive for use in monolithic {3D-ICs} on an arbitrary substrate including a glass and even a plastic for applications such as ultra-high-density memories, logic-to-logic integration, {CPU} integrated display, and high-definition image sensor for artificial retina.},

The simulation results showed that the use of graphene as interconnects as well as heat spreaders lowers the maximum temperature of the chip. The maximum temperature of the chip was studied as a function of the interconnect current and thickness of few-layer graphene.

Quantum-mechanical tunneling and subthreshold leakage current will ultimately limit scaling of silicon field-effect transistors. To continue Moore's law scaling, it is imperative that devices working with a state variable other than electron charge are sought for. Examples of alternate state variables include electron spins, pseudo-spins in graphene, direct and indirect excitons, plasmons, and phonons. At the same time, interconnection aspects of devices utilizing novel state variables must be considered early on. This paper provides a framework to quantify energy dissipation in interconnects for novel state variables. Models for energy per bit are then used along with previously derived models for delay of interconnects for novel state variables to compare performance and energy dissipation of novel interconnects with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS)} interconnects. Comparison results provide important insights into material, device, and circuit implications of post-{CMOS} technologies.},

	abstract = {Three dimensional stacked integrated circuits ({3D} {ICs)} are extremely attractive for overcoming the barriers in interconnect scaling, offering an opportunity to continue the {CMOS} performance trends for the next decade. However, from a thermal perspective, vertical integration of high-performance {ICs} in the form of {3D} stacks is highly demanding since the effective areal heat dissipation increases with number of dies (with hotspot heat fluxes up to {250W/cm2)} generating high chip temperatures. In this context, inter-tier integrated microchannel cooling is a promising and scalable solution for high heat flux removal. A robust design of a {3D} {IC} and its subsequent thermal management depend heavily upon accurate modeling of the effects of liquid cooling on the thermal behavior of the {IC} during the early stages of design. In this paper we present {3D-ICE}, a compact transient thermal model ({CTTM)} for the thermal simulation of {3D} {ICs} with multiple inter-tier microchannel liquid cooling. The proposed model is compatible with existing thermal {CAD} tools for {ICs}, and offers significant speed-up (up to 975x) over a typical commercial computational fluid dynamics simulation tool while preserving accuracy (i.e., maximum temperature error of 3.4\%). In addition, a thermal simulator has been built based on {3D-ICE}, which is capable of running in parallel on multicore architectures, offering further savings in simulation time and demonstrating efficient parallelization of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Many previous works in partitioning have used some underlying clustering algorithm to improve performance. As problem sizes reach new levels of complexity, a single application of a clustering algorithm is insufficient to produce excellent solutions. Recent work has illustrated the promise of multilevel approaches. A multilevel partitioning algorithm recursively clusters the instance until its size is smaller than a given threshold, then unclusters the instance, while applying a partitioning refinement algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new multilevel partitioning algorithm that exploits some of the latest innovations of classical iterative partitioning approaches. Our method also uses a new technique to control the number of levels in our matching-based clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that our heuristic outperforms numerous existing bipartitioning heuristics with improvements ranging from 6.9 to 27.9\% for 100 runs and 3.0 to 20.6\% for just ten runs (while also using less {CPU} time). Further, our algorithm generates solutions better than the best known mincut bipartitionings for seven of the {ACM/SIGDA} benchmark circuits, including golem3 (which has over 100000 cells). We also present quadrisection results which compare favorably to the partitionings obtained by the {GORDIAN} cell placement tool.

It may be applied to automatically partition a gate-level netlist into a minimum cost {3D} {IC.} The number of layers of the lowest cost {3D} {IC} design is noted as {Min\_Cost\_Layer} of the design. We develop a multilevel multilayer partitioning program. It partitions a gate level netlist into a K-layer {3D} {IC} structure. Its objective is to minimize the total number of {TSVs} under an area constraint. The program is applied to benchmark circuits to study the relation between the cost of {3D} {ICs} and the number of partition layer K. The relation shows two classes of curves. One class shows “smiling” curves and the other shows “upward” curves. Our study shows the {Min\_Cost\_Layer} of a circuit depends on the ratio of total {TSV} area to the die area. We also find the upper bound of the {Min\_Cost\_Layer.} Therefore, we propose two methods: {“Less\_TSV”} and {“More\_TSV”} prediction methods. According to the processing technology and connectivity of a circuit, we select the appropriate method. The experimental results show that combining the {Min\_Cost\_Layer} prediction methods and the partitioning program, we can get the minimum cost {3D} {IC} of a circuit effectively.

	abstract = {Elmore delay has been widely used to estimate interconnect delays in the performance-driven synthesis and layout of very-large-scale-integration ({VLSI)} routing topologies. For typical {RLC} interconnections, however, Elmore delay can deviate significantly from {SPICE-computed} delay, since it is independent of inductance of the interconnect and rise time of the input signal. Here, we develop an analytical delay model based on first and second moments to incorporate inductance effects into the delay estimate for interconnection lines under step input. Delay estimates using our analytical model are within 15\% of {SPICE-computed} delay across a wide range of interconnect parameter values. We also extend our delay model for estimation of source-sink delays in arbitrary interconnect trees. We observe significant improvement in the accuracy of delay estimates for interconnect trees when compared to the Elmore model, yet our estimates are as easy to compute as Elmore delay. Evaluation of our analytical models is several orders of magnitude faster than simulation using {SPICE.} We also illustrate the application of our model in controlling response undershoot/overshoot and reducing interconnect delay through constraints on the moments},

However to achieve {3D} monolithic integration, some issues such as realization of high quality top film, high stability bottom {FET}, low thermal budget top {FET} still have to be solved. In this work, a {3D} monolithic process flow relying on molecular wafer bonding is proposed and results in all critical steps are given. Significant breakthroughs have been obtained using a full wafer molecular bonding with thin interlayer dielectric and an original salicidation process stabilized up to {650oC} enabling to reach high performance for the top and bottom transistor.},

	abstract ={A key element for future silicon IC technology development is the containment of electromigration  induced failure of Cu / low-k interconnects. Continued progress in meeting electromigration reliability requirements for future technology nodes will require a multi-faceted approach to the problem: first the development of effective process solutions to limit the impact of technology scaling on electromigration life-time reduction; and second, the provision of models of failure that are representative of circuit operation to determine realistic current-limiting design rules. We will show that process solutions involve limiting the rate of transport along interfaces and grain boundaries in the damascene trench architecture using metal capping layers and Cu alloys. Most models of electromigration failure have been developed using DC stress conditions, while circuits predominantly operate with non-DC (pulsed DC or AC) signals. Understanding the relationship between failure under DC and non-DC conditions is a necessary aspect of realistic reliability characterization. In this paper we review: our recent studies that establish the relationship between Cu microstructure, metallic capping and dilute Cu alloy additions and thereby identify effective scenarios for mitigation with technology scaling; and experimental studies of electromigration failure under non-DC stress that explore the physical mechanisms involved.},
